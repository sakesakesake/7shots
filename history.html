                    <h3>Sake is a link</h3>
                     <p>
                    It is said that people made sake approximately 
                    2000 years ago when rice cultivation was 
                    introduced to Japan. The origin of sake was very sacred 
                    and was used for religious reasons.  'Mouth bite liquor' which
                    a kind of rice-based alcohol produced by a process involving 
                    human saliva as a fermentation starter.
                    The work of biting was limited to shrine maiden only.<br>
                    It is still consumed on religious special ocasions in Japan.  
                    Sometimes sake is offered at festivals at shrines.
                    Also, sake was essential drink for people for celebration such as 
                    wedding, seasonal events and new years.  Sake is a link between people
                     and the Japanese Gods.
