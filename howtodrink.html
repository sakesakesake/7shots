                    <h3>Drink Sake</h3>
                     <p>
                        There are two ways to drink Sake.<br>
                        It is either "cold" or "hot".<br>
                        I personally prefer cold sake in summer days, and hot sake 
                        for winter days.  Normally expensive sake is for cold.   
                     </p>
                     <h3>Hot Sake</h3>
                     <p>Hot sake is approximately 42F.<br>
                    1,  Pour sake into decanter.<br> 2,  Boil water in a saucepan.<br>
                    3,  Turn off the heat and gently lower the container of sake 
                    into the water.<br> Well, if it is too much work, microwave for 
                    30 to 60 seconds and that will do too.</p>
                    <h3>Where can I find sake?</h3>
                    <p>Normally, asian supermarket have some types of sake.<br>
                    Sometimes asian restaurants serve sake too.  The tricky part is a lot of 
                    people mistake Korean Soju for Japanese sake.  They are completely different 
                    alcohol.  Sake doesn't have fruit flavors so if the drink you got have nice strawberry 
                    flavors, they are not sake.</p>
